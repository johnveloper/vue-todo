# VueTodo V1
A simple Todo app made with Vue 2.6.10 after reading official [Vue Guide > Essentials](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html).   
I've used no components or tools for this app (Vue is linked with a `script` tag) so I'll develop a refactored versions of the same app as I learn more about Vue.
